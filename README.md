# The-Spark-Foundation---Supervised ML---Task-1

In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

# The-Spark-Foundation---Unsupervised ML---Task-2

In this section you will get a explanation of second task as well as difference between supervised and unsupervised ML. we have used 'iris' dataset here.

And we have predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

# The-Spark-Foundation---Exploratory Data Analysis---Task-3

In this section, we have perform 'Exploratory data Analysis' on dataset 'SampleSuperstore'.

We have found here weak areas and business problem as well as some tips of work to make more profit. This is amazing task and you will learn alot here.

Basically i have used jupter notebook for run this code and used some basic python libraries like - Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Warnings etc.
