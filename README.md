# The-Spark-Foundation---// Supervised ML //---Task-1

In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

# The-Spark-Foundation---// Unsupervised ML //---Task-2

In this section you will get a explanation of second task as well as difference between supervised and unsupervised ML. we have used 'iris' dataset here.

And we have predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

# The-Spark-Foundation---// Exploratory Data Analysis //---Task-3

In this section, we have perform 'Exploratory data Analysis' on dataset 'SampleSuperstore'.

We have found here weak areas and business problem as well as some tips of work to make more profit. This is amazing task and you will learn alot here.

Basically i have used jupyter notebook for run this code and used some basic python libraries like - Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Warnings etc.

**Conclusion ** 
1. Weak Areas -
i) We should limit sales of furniture and increase that of technology and office suppliers as furniture has very less profit as compared to sales.
ii) Increase sales more in the east as profit is more.
iii) Need to give some discount and other offer in state (colorado, texas, north carolina,ohio) because there is sale is fine but no profit.
2. Other Findings :
i) Over Less quantity of products also the sales were high.
ii) The features Profit and Discounts are highly related.
iii) The Home Office provides highest sales followed by Corporate by a slight variation.
iv) We should concentrate on the states like 'New York' and 'California' to make more profits.


# The-Spark-Foundation---// Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism //---Task-4

In this section, we have perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism' on dataset 'Global Terrorism'

We have found here hot zone of the terrorism. And analysed the data of INDIA.

you can run this code on your Jupyter notebook as well as Spider. 

And I have shared complete visualization part of the task using Matplotlib and Seaborn etc. And some more basic libraries like-pandas, numpy, warning etc.

**Conclusion ** 
1. Most attacks in Country - Iraq

2. Most attacks in City - Baghdad

3. Most attacks in Region - Middle East & North Africa

4. Least attacks in Region - Australasia & Oceania

5. Most attacks in year - 2014

6. Most attacks in Month - 5

7. Most attacks by Group - Taliban

8. Most attacks type - Bombing/Explsion

9. Most target type by terriorst - Private Citizens/Property

10. Most target Continent - Asia

11. Least attacks type - Hijecking

12. least attacks in year - 1971

India:
 1. Most effected state - J&K
 2. Most effected city - Sri Nagar
 3. Most terriorst group - CPI- Maoist
 4. Most effected yesr - 2016
 5. Least effected year - 1976,1977,1972,1975
 6. Most attack type - Bombing/Explosion
 7. Least attack type - Hijecking

In the majority of acts of terrorism, the majority rate and injuries were low but a small number of action led to too many deaths and injuries.

Note: I have not considered unknown data.


# The-Spark-Foundation---// Exploratory Data Analysis //---Task-5

In this section, we have perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis - on dataset 'Indian Premier League'

We have found here over-all information about the player as well as performance in IPL matches.
you can run this code on your Jupyter notebook as well as Spider. 

And I have shared complete visualization part of the task using Matplotlib and Seaborn etc. And some more basic libraries like-pandas, numpy, warning etc.

**Conclusion ** 
Report :

Teams & Factors
1.The highest number of match won by Mumbai Indians and has won the most number of toss.
2.After winning toss more teams decide to do fielding first.
3.Teams which Bowl first has higher chances of winning then the team which bat first.
4.The Mumbai city has hosted the most number of IPL matches.

6.All other seasons have approximately 58-60 matches while 2011-2013 have more than 70 matches.
7.10 teams played in 2011 and 9 teams each in 2012 and 2013
8.Most teams field first after winning toss except for Chennai Super Kings who has mostly opted to bat first. Deccan Chargers and Pune Warriors also show the same trend.
9.According this dataset 9 times match has tie result
10.Super over value is 81 times.
11.caught ball is the most dismissals in IPL
12.Maximum number of four & six hit by team Chennai Super Kings
13.Total 14 teams participated in 2008-2019 out of which only 6 teams manged to win the IPL title.

Player
1.Chris Gayle has won the maximum number of player of the match title.
2.The highest number of six hit by player is CH gayle.
3.Top leading run scorer in IPL are Virat kholi, SK Raina, RG Sharma
4.Dismissals in IPL was most by Catch out 
5.S. Ravi(Sundaram Ravi) has officiated the most number of IPL matches on-field.

# The-Spark-Foundation---// Exploratory Data Analysis //---Task-6

In this task, we have Created the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

Decision tree algorithms is the Supervised learning. The purpose of create the Decision tree classsifier is if we feed any new data in this classifier, it would be able to predict right class accordingly.The goal of using Decision tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the classes and value of the target variable by simple learning rules. And this algorithms can perform both classification, regression and multioutput tasks. let's check ans start with the iris dataset.

1. iris - setosa can easily be identified whereas the iris - versicolor & iris - virginics are overlapping.
2. Petal-length and Petal Width is important feature for identifying the flower

#The-Spark-Foundation---// Exploratory Data Analysis //---Task-7

Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis

Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines.

Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)

Download historical stock prices from @finance.yahoo.com
Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6

You are free to select a different stock to analyze and news dataset as well while not changing the objective of the task.

Conclusion - 

RandomForest = 0.05257968397499098
DecisionTree = 0.10831900809236311
AdaBoost = 0.05492347045438241
LightGBM = 0.0583079056070462
XGBoost = 0.05968830860645931 From here we can see that RandomForestRegressor shows a better performance than the others.
