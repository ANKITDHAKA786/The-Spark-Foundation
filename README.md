# The-Spark-Foundation---// Supervised ML //---Task-1

In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

# The-Spark-Foundation---// Unsupervised ML //---Task-2

In this section you will get a explanation of second task as well as difference between supervised and unsupervised ML. we have used 'iris' dataset here.

And we have predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

# The-Spark-Foundation---// Exploratory Data Analysis //---Task-3

In this section, we have perform 'Exploratory data Analysis' on dataset 'SampleSuperstore'.

We have found here weak areas and business problem as well as some tips of work to make more profit. This is amazing task and you will learn alot here.

Basically i have used jupyter notebook for run this code and used some basic python libraries like - Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Warnings etc.

**Conclusion ** 
1. Weak Areas -
i) We should limit sales of furniture and increase that of technology and office suppliers as furniture has very less profit as compared to sales.
ii) Increase sales more in the east as profit is more.
iii) Need to give some discount and other offer in state (colorado, texas, north carolina,ohio) because there is sale is fine but no profit.
2. Other Findings :
i) Over Less quantity of products also the sales were high.
ii) The features Profit and Discounts are highly related.
iii) The Home Office provides highest sales followed by Corporate by a slight variation.
iv) We should concentrate on the states like 'New York' and 'California' to make more profits.


# The-Spark-Foundation---// Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism //---Task-4

In this section, we have perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism' on dataset 'Global Terrorism'

We have found here hot zone of the terrorism. And analysed the data of INDIA.

you can run this code on your Jupyter notebook as well as Spider. 

And I have shared complete visualization part of the task using Matplotlib and Seaborn etc. And some more basic libraries like-pandas, numpy, warning etc.

**Conclusion ** 
1. Most attacks in Country - Iraq

2. Most attacks in City - Baghdad

3. Most attacks in Region - Middle East & North Africa

4. Least attacks in Region - Australasia & Oceania

5. Most attacks in year - 2014

6. Most attacks in Month - 5

7. Most attacks by Group - Taliban

8. Most attacks type - Bombing/Explsion

9. Most target type by terriorst - Private Citizens/Property

10. Most target Continent - Asia

11. Least attacks type - Hijecking

12. least attacks in year - 1971

India:
 1. Most effected state - J&K
 2. Most effected city - Sri Nagar
 3. Most terriorst group - CPI- Maoist
 4. Most effected yesr - 2016
 5. Least effected year - 1976,1977,1972,1975
 6. Most attack type - Bombing/Explosion
 7. Least attack type - Hijecking

In the majority of acts of terrorism, the majority rate and injuries were low but a small number of action led to too many deaths and injuries.

Note: I have not considered unknown data.
